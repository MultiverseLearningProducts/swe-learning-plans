# REST Assured

REST Assured is a powerful Java-based library for testing RESTful APIs. It provides a simple and intuitive DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for writing expressive and readable tests, making it a popular choice for API testing in the Java ecosystem. By learning REST Assured, you'll gain the skills needed to automate API testing, validate responses, and ensure the functionality, reliability, and performance of RESTful web services.

REST Assured was created by Johan Haleby in 2009 and has since become one of the most widely used frameworks for API testing in the Java community. It was developed to address the need for a simple and efficient way to test RESTful APIs. The library is built on top of the popular Apache HttpClient and offers a higher-level abstraction for interacting with APIs, reducing boilerplate code and making tests more readable.

REST Assured leverages the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture, which is widely adopted in modern web services. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, and REST Assured provides a convenient and flexible way to send these requests, validate responses, and extract data from them.

The learning plan for REST Assured is designed to provide a step-by-step approach for mastering the framework. It starts with the basics of RESTful APIs and HTTP methods, then introduces you to the features and capabilities of REST Assured. You'll learn how to write tests, handle authentication, work with request and response headers, and validate responses using assertions.

As you progress through the learning plan, you'll explore more advanced topics such as error handling, logging, and reporting. You'll also delve into real-world scenarios like handling JSON/XML responses, file uploads, and cookies. Additionally, the plan covers integrating REST Assured with test automation frameworks, organizing test code effectively, and writing tests for complex scenarios.
