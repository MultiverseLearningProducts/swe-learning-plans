<h1 id="sql">SQL</h1>
<p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to
manage and manipulate relational databases. It was first developed in
the 1970s by IBM researchers, who were looking for a way to query and
manage data stored in relational databases.</p>
<p>SQL has since become the standard language for relational database
management systems (RDBMS), and is used by many popular database
systems, including MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and
PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Learning SQL is an important skill for anyone who works with data,
including analysts, developers, and data scientists. It allows you to
extract insights from large sets of data and to manipulate and manage
databases efficiently.</p>
<p>In this learning plan, you will be introduced to SQL through a
step-by-step process that covers the basics of SQL, filtering and
sorting data, advanced queries, modifying data, and advanced topics like
subqueries, aggregate functions, and views.</p>
<p>By the end of this learning plan, you will have a solid foundation in
SQL and the ability to write SQL queries to manipulate and manage data
in a variety of contexts. With SQL being such an essential tool for data
management and analysis, mastering it will give you a valuable skill set
for many industries and applications.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Once you have completed your learning plan, there are several things
you can do to continue improving your SQL skills:</p>
<p><strong>Practice, practice, practice</strong> - keep working on
projects that involve databases and SQL. The more you practice writing
queries and manipulating data, the more comfortable and confident you
will become with SQL. Learn advanced SQL topics: There are many advanced
SQL topics that you can explore, such as stored procedures, triggers,
and window functions. These topics can help you work more efficiently
with databases and solve more complex problems.</p>
<p><strong>Database management systems (DBMS)</strong> - understanding
how to use a specific DBMS, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, can help you
work more efficiently with databases and learn new features and
capabilities that are specific to the system.</p>
<p><strong>Data visualization</strong> - SQL is often used in
conjunction with data visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or
Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. Learning how to create data
visualizations can help you better understand data and communicate your
findings to others.</p>
<p><strong>Participate in online communities</strong> - join online
communities like Stack Overflow or Reddit to ask questions, share your
knowledge, and learn from others. You can also find forums or groups
dedicated to specific DBMSs or SQL topics.</p>
