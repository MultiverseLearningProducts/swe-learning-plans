# C++

C++ is a powerful and widely used programming language known for its efficiency,
flexibility, and performance. It is an extension of the C programming language
with added features and object-oriented programming (OOP) capabilities. Learning
C++ can open up a world of opportunities in software development, ranging from
systems programming to game development, scientific computing, and more.

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, in the early
1980s at Bell Labs. Stroustrup wanted to enhance the C programming language to
support object-oriented programming while retaining its low-level system
programming capabilities. He named the language "C++" to represent the
incremental nature of its development, as "++" is the increment operator in C.

C++ builds upon the foundations of C and adds several key features, including
classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates. These additions
allow developers to design and create complex software systems using modular and
reusable components.

Over the years, C++ has undergone several revisions and enhancements. The first
standardized version of the language, known as "C++98," was published in 1998 as
an international standard (ISO/IEC 14882:1998). Subsequent revisions, such as
"C++03," "C++11," "C++14," "C++17," and "C++20," introduced new features,
improved the language's expressiveness, and enhanced its performance.

C++ has gained widespread popularity and is widely used in various domains,
including systems programming, embedded systems, game development,
high-performance computing, and financial applications. It remains a vital
language in the software development industry, with a rich ecosystem of
libraries, frameworks, and tools supporting its usage.

By following this learning plan, you will gain a solid foundation in C++
programming and develop the necessary skills to write efficient and maintainable
