# Networking: UDP and TCP

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) are two
of the most commonly used transport layer protocols in computer networking. They
were both developed as part of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, which provides
a standardized set of rules and protocols for transmitting data over the
internet.

UDP was first introduced in 1980 by David P. Reed and colleagues at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was designed as a lightweight
protocol that could provide low-latency communication between devices,
particularly for applications that require real-time data transfer such as
online gaming and streaming media. UDP operates on a connectionless basis, which
means that it does not establish a dedicated communication channel between
devices before transmitting data. Instead, it simply sends packets of data to
the destination device, and it is up to the receiving device to determine
whether the packets are valid and in the correct order.

TCP, on the other hand, was introduced in 1981 by Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn at
Stanford University. It was designed as a more reliable alternative to UDP,
particularly for applications that require guaranteed data delivery such as file
transfers and email. TCP operates on a connection-oriented basis, which means
that it establishes a dedicated communication channel between devices before
transmitting data. This allows it to provide error checking, flow control, and
congestion control mechanisms to ensure that data is transmitted reliably and
efficiently.

Since their introduction, UDP and TCP have become integral parts of the internet
and are used by a wide variety of applications and services. Understanding how
they work and their respective strengths and weaknesses can be invaluable for
anyone interested in computer networking.
