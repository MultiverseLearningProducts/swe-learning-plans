# Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the management and configuration of computer systems. It was created by Michael DeHaan and first released in 2012. In 2015, Ansible, Inc. (later acquired by Red Hat) was formed to provide commercial support and services for Ansible.

The main goal behind Ansible is to enable IT teams to automate repetitive tasks, streamline complex processes, and achieve efficient system management. Ansible follows a declarative language approach, allowing users to define the desired state of a system or infrastructure, and Ansible takes care of the necessary steps to reach that state.

Ansible differentiates itself from other configuration management tools by adopting an agentless architecture. It communicates with managed hosts over SSH or WinRM, using a push-based model. This means that Ansible does not require any additional software to be installed on the managed hosts, making it lightweight and flexible.

Ansible uses YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as its preferred language for writing playbooks. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that is easy to understand and write. Playbooks in Ansible describe the desired state of a system and define a series of tasks to be executed on managed hosts.

Since its release, Ansible has gained widespread popularity due to its simplicity, ease of use, and scalability. It has become a prominent tool in the DevOps ecosystem, enabling infrastructure automation, application deployment, configuration management, and orchestration.

Ansible's open-source nature has led to a large and active community that contributes to its development, provides support, and shares best practices and modules through platforms like Ansible Galaxy.

Today, Ansible continues to evolve with regular updates and enhancements from the Ansible community and Red Hat. It remains a powerful and widely adopted automation tool, enabling organizations to achieve efficiency, consistency, and scalability in their IT operations.
