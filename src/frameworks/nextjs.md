# Next.js

Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered and
statically generated web applications. It was first released in 2016 by Zeit, a
company that was later acquired by Vercel. Since then, Next.js has gained
popularity in the web development community due to its ability to easily create
scalable and performant web applications.

Next.js was created to solve some of the challenges faced by developers when
building React applications, such as slow initial page load times and difficulty
implementing server-side rendering. It provides features such as automatic code
splitting, server-side rendering, and static site generation out of the box,
making it easier to create high-performing web applications.

In recent years, Next.js has been adopted by many big-name companies like Hulu,
Twitch, and Nike to build their web applications. This has led to increased
community support and the development of many useful plugins and libraries for
Next.js.

This learning plan is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in
Next.js, from the basics of pages and routing to more advanced topics like data
fetching and deployment. By the end of this plan, you should have the skills to
build your own Next.js applications and be well-equipped to continue learning
and exploring the framework on your own.
