## State Management with Pinia

1. Understand how to create a Pinia store using the `defineStore` function. This
   involves defining the state, actions, mutations, and getters for your store.

   - Create a new Pinia store for a specific feature or functionality in your
     Vue app.
   - Define the state properties, actions, mutations, and getters within the
     store.

2. Learn how to manage and access the state of your store. Pinia provides a
   simple API to read or modify the state using actions and mutations.

   - Access the state properties of the store from your Vue components
   - Modify the state properties using mutations and observe how the changes
     reflect in your components.

3. Master the concept of actions, which are asynchronous methods used to perform
   side effects or trigger mutations. Learn how to write actions, access the
   store's state, and optionally return values.

   - Write an asynchronous action that makes an API request and updates the
     state with the response.
   - Use the `await` keyword inside an action to wait for a Promise to resolve
     before executing the next line of code.

4. Understand the role of mutations, which are synchronous methods used to
   modify the state. Learn how to define mutations and access the store's state
   within them.

   - Create a mutation to update a specific state property of the store.
   - Modify the state using a mutation and observe the change in the component
     where the state is being used.

5. Explore how to define and use getters to compute derived state based on the
   store's state. Getters are useful for performing calculations or filtering
   data.

   - Define a getter that computes and returns a derived state based on the
     existing state properties.
   - Access and use the getter within your Vue components to display calculated
     data.

Remember to use the Pinia documentation and resources as you practice each
topic. It will provide detailed explanations and examples to support your
learning journey. Good luck!
