<h1 id="java">Java</h1>
<p>Java is a popular programming language that was first introduced by
Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to be portable, secure, and
easy to use, and it quickly gained popularity among developers. Today,
Java is used to build a wide variety of applications, from desktop and
mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.</p>
<p>This learning plan is designed to introduce you to the basics of Java
programming and help you build a solid foundation in the language. Over
the course of five days, you will learn about topics such as basic
syntax, object-oriented programming, exception handling, file I/O, and
more. By the end of the learning plan, you should have a good
understanding of the key concepts and tools used in Java
programming.</p>
<p>Java has evolved significantly since its inception, with new versions
and updates being released regularly. The language is maintained by
Oracle Corporation, which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010. Today, Java
is widely used in the enterprise space and is also a popular choice for
building Android mobile apps.</p>
<p>Learning Java can be a great way to expand your programming skills
and open up new career opportunities. We hope that this learning plan
will provide you with a solid foundation in Java programming and help
you get started on your journey to becoming a skilled Java
developer.</p>
