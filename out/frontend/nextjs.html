<h1 id="next.js">Next.js</h1>
<p>Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-side
rendered and statically generated web applications. It was first
released in 2016 by Zeit, a company that was later acquired by Vercel.
Since then, Next.js has gained popularity in the web development
community due to its ability to easily create scalable and performant
web applications.</p>
<p>Next.js was created to solve some of the challenges faced by
developers when building React applications, such as slow initial page
load times and difficulty implementing server-side rendering. It
provides features such as automatic code splitting, server-side
rendering, and static site generation out of the box, making it easier
to create high-performing web applications.</p>
<p>In recent years, Next.js has been adopted by many big-name companies
like Hulu, Twitch, and Nike to build their web applications. This has
led to increased community support and the development of many useful
plugins and libraries for Next.js.</p>
