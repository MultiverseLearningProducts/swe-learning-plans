# Java

Java is a popular programming language that was first introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to be portable, secure, and easy to use, and it quickly gained popularity among developers. Today, Java is used to build a wide variety of applications, from desktop and mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems.

This learning plan is designed to introduce you to the basics of Java programming and help you build a solid foundation in the language. Over the course of five days, you will learn about topics such as basic syntax, object-oriented programming, exception handling, file I/O, and more. By the end of the learning plan, you should have a good understanding of the key concepts and tools used in Java programming.

Java has evolved significantly since its inception, with new versions and updates being released regularly. The language is maintained by Oracle Corporation, which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010. Today, Java is widely used in the enterprise space and is also a popular choice for building Android mobile apps.

Learning Java can be a great way to expand your programming skills and open up new career opportunities. We hope that this learning plan will provide you with a solid foundation in Java programming and help you get started on your journey to becoming a skilled Java developer.
