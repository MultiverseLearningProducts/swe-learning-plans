<h1 id="react">React</h1>
<p>React is a popular frontend JavaScript library for building user
interfaces. It was originally developed by Facebook in 2011 and was
released to the public in 2013 as an open-source project. React has
since become one of the most widely used frontend frameworks, with a
large and active community of developers.</p>
<p>React is designed to make it easy to build complex, interactive user
interfaces by breaking them down into small, reusable components. These
components can be composed together to create more complex components,
and ultimately an entire application.</p>
<p>One of the key features that distinguishes React from other frontend
frameworks is its use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model). The
virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM, which
allows React to make changes to the user interface in a more efficient
way. Instead of making changes to the actual DOM, which can be slow and
resource-intensive, React updates the virtual DOM and then calculates
the most efficient way to update the actual DOM based on those
changes.</p>
<p>Another feature that sets React apart is its emphasis on a
declarative programming model. In a declarative model, you describe what
you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of updating the UI as
necessary. This is in contrast to an imperative programming model, where
you describe the steps necessary to update the UI directly. Declarative
programming can make it easier to reason about complex UIs and reduce
the risk of bugs.</p>
<p>React also has a large ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools,
including state management libraries like Redux, routing libraries like
React Router, and testing frameworks like Jest and Enzyme.</p>
<p>Overall, React is a powerful frontend framework that has gained
popularity thanks to its performance, flexibility, and community
support.</p>
