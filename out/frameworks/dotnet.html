<blockquote>
<p>It is recommended that you do this Learning Plan in combination with
the C# Learning Plan as knowledge of C# is essential for using .NET.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.NET is a comprehensive and versatile software development platform
created by Microsoft. It offers a framework that enables developers to
build a wide range of applications, including web, desktop, mobile,
cloud, gaming, and IoT applications. The core idea behind .NET is to
provide a unified programming model, which allows developers to write
code in multiple programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, and F#, among
others, while seamlessly integrating different technologies and
services.</p>
<p>At the heart of .NET is the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which acts
as the execution engine for managed code. It provides automatic memory
management, security, and exception handling, making applications more
reliable and secure. Additionally, .NET Framework includes a vast class
library, offering a rich set of pre-built components and APIs for common
tasks, simplifying development and reducing coding efforts.</p>
<p>With the introduction of .NET Core, a cross-platform and open-source
implementation of .NET, developers can now build applications that run
on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Furthermore, .NET Core enables the
development of cloud-native applications that can take full advantage of
the scalability and flexibility offered by modern cloud platforms.
Overall, .NET empowers developers to create robust, scalable, and
high-performance applications, leveraging its extensive set of tools,
libraries, and frameworks.</p>
