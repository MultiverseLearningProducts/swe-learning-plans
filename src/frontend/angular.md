# Angular

Angular is a front-end web framework for building dynamic web applications using
TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. It provides a set of powerful tools and
features for building complex, scalable, and maintainable web applications.
Angular was initially developed by Google in 2010 and is currently maintained by
a team of developers and contributors.

Angular is particularly well-suited for building single-page applications (SPAs)
and dynamic web applications that require a lot of user interaction and
real-time data updates. It's also useful for creating large, enterprise-level
applications with complex business logic and data processing requirements. Many
popular websites and applications, such as Google Cloud Platform, Netflix, and
PayPal, use Angular for their front-end development.

The first version of Angular, called AngularJS, was released in 2010. It gained
popularity quickly and became one of the most widely-used front-end frameworks
for building web applications. However, AngularJS had some limitations,
particularly in terms of performance and scalability, so a new version of
Angular, called Angular 2, was released in 2016. Angular 2 introduced
significant changes and improvements, including a modular architecture, improved
performance, and support for mobile development. Since then, Angular has
continued to evolve and improve with each new version.

Angular is a comprehensive framework that includes many built-in features and
tools, such as a powerful templating system, reactive programming support, and
robust testing tools. It uses TypeScript, a statically-typed language that
provides additional safety and productivity features for developers. Angular
also emphasizes modularity and code organization, making it easier to maintain
and scale large codebases. Additionally, Angular has a large and active
community of developers and contributors, which helps to ensure that the
framework is continuously improving and evolving.
