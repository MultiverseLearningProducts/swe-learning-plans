# SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to manage and
manipulate relational databases. It was first developed in the 1970s by IBM
researchers, who were looking for a way to query and manage data stored in
relational databases.

SQL has since become the standard language for relational database management
systems (RDBMS), and is used by many popular database systems, including MySQL,
Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

Learning SQL is an important skill for anyone who works with data, including
analysts, developers, and data scientists. It allows you to extract insights
from large sets of data and to manipulate and manage databases efficiently.

In this learning plan, you will be introduced to SQL through a step-by-step
process that covers the basics of SQL, filtering and sorting data, advanced
queries, modifying data, and advanced topics like subqueries, aggregate
functions, and views.

By the end of this learning plan, you will have a solid foundation in SQL and
the ability to write SQL queries to manipulate and manage data in a variety of
contexts. With SQL being such an essential tool for data management and
analysis, mastering it will give you a valuable skill set for many industries
and applications.

## Next Steps

Once you have completed your learning plan, there are several things you can do
to continue improving your SQL skills:

**Practice, practice, practice** - keep working on projects that involve
databases and SQL. The more you practice writing queries and manipulating data,
the more comfortable and confident you will become with SQL. Learn advanced SQL
topics: There are many advanced SQL topics that you can explore, such as stored
procedures, triggers, and window functions. These topics can help you work more
efficiently with databases and solve more complex problems.

**Database management systems (DBMS)** - understanding how to use a specific
DBMS, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, can help you work more efficiently with
databases and learn new features and capabilities that are specific to the
system.

**Data visualization** - SQL is often used in conjunction with data
visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries like
Matplotlib or Seaborn. Learning how to create data visualizations can help you
better understand data and communicate your findings to others.

**Participate in online communities** - join online communities like Stack
Overflow or Reddit to ask questions, share your knowledge, and learn from
others. You can also find forums or groups dedicated to specific DBMSs or SQL
topics.
