# Datadog

Datadog is a monitoring and observability platform that helps organizations gain
visibility into their infrastructure, applications, and services. It offers a
comprehensive set of tools and features to collect, analyze, and visualize data
from various sources, enabling efficient monitoring, troubleshooting, and
optimization of systems.

Datadog was founded in 2010 by Olivier Pomel and Alexis Lê-Quôc, with the aim of
providing a unified platform for monitoring cloud-scale applications. The
founders identified the growing complexity of modern infrastructures, which were
transitioning to cloud environments, microservices architectures, and
distributed systems. They saw an opportunity to build a solution that could
effectively monitor and provide visibility into these complex environments.

The company started by focusing on infrastructure monitoring, providing
real-time insights into servers, databases, and other components of the IT
stack. Over time, Datadog expanded its offerings to include application
performance monitoring (APM), log management, synthetic monitoring, and other
observability features. This holistic approach allows organizations to monitor
and analyze their entire technology stack from a single platform.

With its cloud-native approach and robust feature set, Datadog quickly gained
popularity among both startups and enterprises. It became known for its
user-friendly interface, powerful analytics capabilities, and integrations with
a wide range of technologies and services.

The learning plan is designed to help individuals get started with Datadog and
