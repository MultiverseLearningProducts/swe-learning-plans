# React

React is a popular frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It
was originally developed by Facebook in 2011 and was released to the public in
2013 as an open-source project. React has since become one of the most widely
used frontend frameworks, with a large and active community of developers.

React is designed to make it easy to build complex, interactive user interfaces
by breaking them down into small, reusable components. These components can be
composed together to create more complex components, and ultimately an entire
application.

One of the key features that distinguishes React from other frontend frameworks
is its use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model). The virtual DOM is an
in-memory representation of the actual DOM, which allows React to make changes
to the user interface in a more efficient way. Instead of making changes to the
actual DOM, which can be slow and resource-intensive, React updates the virtual
DOM and then calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM based on
those changes.

Another feature that sets React apart is its emphasis on a declarative
programming model. In a declarative model, you describe what you want the UI to
look like, and React takes care of updating the UI as necessary. This is in
contrast to an imperative programming model, where you describe the steps
necessary to update the UI directly. Declarative programming can make it easier
to reason about complex UIs and reduce the risk of bugs.

React also has a large ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools, including
state management libraries like Redux, routing libraries like React Router, and
testing frameworks like Jest and Enzyme.

Overall, React is a powerful frontend framework that has gained popularity
thanks to its performance, flexibility, and community support.

## 1. Getting started with React

- Start by understanding the basics of React and its core concepts.
- Read the official React documentation and try to understand the concepts like
  JSX, components, state, and props.
- Install React on your computer and create a simple "Hello World" application
  to get started.

### Tasks

1. Learn about what React is and its purpose in web development.

   - [ ] Understand the basics of React, including JSX syntax, components,
         state, and props.
   - [ ] Read the official React documentation to get a comprehensive
         understanding of these concepts.

2. Install React

   - [ ] Install React on your computer.
   - [ ] Create a simple "Hello World" application to get started.

Remember, this is just one way you could structure day 1 of your learning plan.
You may find that you want to spend more time on certain topics or skip over
others based on your personal preferences and learning style. The important
thing is to pace yourself and not try to rush through the material too quickly.

## 2. Understanding Components

- Learn how to create React components and the different types of components.
- Understand the component lifecycle and the different methods involved in it.
- Practice creating simple components like buttons, forms, and other UI
  elements.

### Tasks

1. React components

         components, functional components, and stateless components.
   - [ ] Understand how to create a component in React, and the syntax for
         rendering it to the DOM.

2. Component lifecycle

   - [ ] Learn about the component lifecycle in React, including the various
         methods involved in it like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`,
         `componentWillUnmount`, etc.
   - [ ] Understand how to use props to pass data from a parent component to a
         child component.

3. Practice creating components

   - [ ] Create simple components like buttons, forms, and other UI elements to
         gain proficiency in creating components.
   - [ ] Learn about component composition, where you can combine multiple
         components to create more complex UIs.
   - [ ] Learn how to use React Fragments to group a list of children elements
         without adding extra markup to the DOM.

Again, this is just one way you could structure day 2 of your learning plan.
Feel free to adjust the pace or order of topics based on your personal
preferences and learning style. By the end of Day 2, you should have a good
understanding of the fundamentals of the React library.

## 3. Working with State and Props

- Learn how to work with state and props in React.
- Understand how to pass data between components using props.
- Practice creating components that utilise state and props to create dynamic
  UIs.

         component data.
   - [ ] Learn how to update the state of a component using the setState method.

2. Working with Props

         together to create dynamic UIs.
   - [ ] Practice creating components that utilize state and props to create
         dynamic UIs, such as a counter or a simple form that saves data to
         state.
   - [ ] Learn about lifting state up, which is a pattern used in React to
         manage state at a higher level of the component hierarchy.
