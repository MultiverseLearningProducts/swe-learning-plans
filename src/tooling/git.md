# Git

This learning plan is designed to help you learn how to use Git, which is a popular version control system used by software developers all over the world. Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, in 2005, and it quickly became a popular tool for managing code.

Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine. This makes it easy for developers to work on code independently and collaborate effectively with each other.

Over the years, Git has become an essential tool for software development, and it is now used by millions of developers around the world. By learning how to use Git effectively, you can improve your ability to manage code, collaborate with other developers, and work more efficiently on software projects.

This learning plan is designed to be completed in five days and includes a variety of topics, including basic Git concepts, branching and merging, advanced Git commands, Git workflows, troubleshooting, and Git extensions. By the end of this learning plan, you should have a solid understanding of how to use Git and be able to apply your knowledge to real-world software development projects.

      - [ ] Create a new feature branch for your work.
      - [ ] Make changes to the feature branch and commit them.
      - [ ] Merge the feature branch into the develop branch when it's ready.
      - [ ] Release the code from the develop branch to the master branch when it's stable.

      #### GitHub Flow

      This workflow is based on a single branch - usually the main branch - and uses pull requests for new work. Here are some steps to follow:

      - [ ] Create a new branch for your work.
      - [ ] Make changes to the branch and commit them.
      - [ ] Open a pull request to merge the branch into the main branch when it's ready.
      - [ ] Review and approve the pull request.
      - [ ] Merge the branch into the main branch.

      #### GitLab Flow

      This workflow is similar to GitHub Flow but uses environments for testing and deployment. Here are some steps to follow:

      - [ ] Create a new branch for your work.
      - [ ] Make changes to the branch and commit them.
      - [ ] Open a merge request to merge the branch into the main branch when it's ready.
      - [ ] Review and approve the merge request.
      - [ ] Deploy the code to a testing environment for testing.
      - [ ] Merge the branch into the main branch and deploy to production.

2. Git Best Practices:

   - [ ] Learn about Git best practices like writing clear commit messages, using descriptive branch names, and avoiding committing directly to the main branch. These practices can help you maintain a clean and well-organized Git history.
   - [ ] Practice implementing these best practices on a sample project. Here are some general guidelines:
     - Write clear and concise commit messages that summarize your changes.
     - Use descriptive branch names that convey the purpose of the branch.
     - Avoid committing directly to the main branch or any other long-lived branch.
     - Use merge or pull request reviews to ensure that changes are reviewed before they're merged into a long-lived branch.
     - Keep your Git history clean by removing unnecessary or sensitive information from your commits.
