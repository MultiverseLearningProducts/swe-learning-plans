# Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)

Protocol Buffers, or Protobuf, is a language-agnostic binary serialization
format developed by Google. Protobuf offers a compact and efficient way to
serialize and deserialize structured data, making it a popular choice for data
exchange in various applications. This learning plan will guide you through
understanding the basics of Protobuf and how to work with it effectively.
