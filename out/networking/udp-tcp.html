<h1 id="networking-udp-and-tcp">Networking: UDP and TCP</h1>
<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) are two of the most commonly used transport layer protocols in
computer networking. They were both developed as part of the Internet
Protocol (IP) suite, which provides a standardized set of rules and
protocols for transmitting data over the internet.</p>
<p>UDP was first introduced in 1980 by David P. Reed and colleagues at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was designed as a
lightweight protocol that could provide low-latency communication
between devices, particularly for applications that require real-time
data transfer such as online gaming and streaming media. UDP operates on
a connectionless basis, which means that it does not establish a
dedicated communication channel between devices before transmitting
data. Instead, it simply sends packets of data to the destination
device, and it is up to the receiving device to determine whether the
packets are valid and in the correct order.</p>
<p>TCP, on the other hand, was introduced in 1981 by Vint Cerf and
Robert Kahn at Stanford University. It was designed as a more reliable
alternative to UDP, particularly for applications that require
guaranteed data delivery such as file transfers and email. TCP operates
on a connection-oriented basis, which means that it establishes a
dedicated communication channel between devices before transmitting
data. This allows it to provide error checking, flow control, and
congestion control mechanisms to ensure that data is transmitted
reliably and efficiently.</p>
<p>Since their introduction, UDP and TCP have become integral parts of
the internet and are used by a wide variety of applications and
services. Understanding how they work and their respective strengths and
weaknesses can be invaluable for anyone interested in computer
networking.</p>
