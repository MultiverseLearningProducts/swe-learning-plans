# React

> If you completed Bootcamp, then some portions of this plan will be review.

React is a popular frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It
was originally developed by Facebook in 2011 and was released to the public in
2013 as an open-source project. React has since become one of the most widely
used frontend frameworks, with a large and active community of developers.

React is designed to make it easy to build complex, interactive user interfaces
by breaking them down into small, reusable components. These components can be
composed together to create more complex components, and ultimately an entire
application.

One of the key features that distinguishes React from other frontend frameworks
is its use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model). The virtual DOM is an
in-memory representation of the actual DOM, which allows React to make changes
to the user interface in a more efficient way. Instead of making changes to the
actual DOM, which can be slow and resource-intensive, React updates the virtual
DOM and then calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM based on
those changes.

Another feature that sets React apart is its emphasis on a declarative
programming model. In a declarative model, you describe what you want the UI to
look like, and React takes care of updating the UI as necessary. This is in
contrast to an imperative programming model, where you describe the steps
necessary to update the UI directly. Declarative programming can make it easier
to reason about complex UIs and reduce the risk of bugs.

React also has a large ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools, including
state management libraries like Redux, routing libraries like React Router, and
testing frameworks like Jest and Enzyme.

Overall, React is a powerful frontend framework that has gained popularity
thanks to its performance, flexibility, and community support.
