# .NET

>It is recommended that you do this Learning Plan in combination with the C# Learning Plan as knowledge of C# is essential for using .NET.

.NET is a comprehensive and versatile software development platform created by Microsoft. It offers a framework that enables developers to build a wide range of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, cloud, gaming, and IoT applications. The core idea behind .NET is to provide a unified programming model, which allows developers to write code in multiple programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, and F#, among others, while seamlessly integrating different technologies and services.

At the heart of .NET is the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which acts as the execution engine for managed code. It provides automatic memory management, security, and exception handling, making applications more reliable and secure. Additionally, .NET Framework includes a vast class library, offering a rich set of pre-built components and APIs for common tasks, simplifying development and reducing coding efforts.

With the introduction of .NET Core, a cross-platform and open-source implementation of .NET, developers can now build applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Furthermore, .NET Core enables the development of cloud-native applications that can take full advantage of the scalability and flexibility offered by modern cloud platforms. Overall, .NET empowers developers to create robust, scalable, and high-performance applications, leveraging its extensive set of tools, libraries, and frameworks.
