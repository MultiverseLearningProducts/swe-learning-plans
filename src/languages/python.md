   - Create an object of the class and access its attributes and methods.
   - Write a program that uses a class to model a real-world object.
     - E.g. Create a `Person` class with a `name`, `age`, and `hometown`
       properties. The class should also have a `bio` method that prints on the
       persons information.

2. Inheritance

   - Create a subclass that inherits from a superclass.
   - Override a method in the subclass.
   - Use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes that models a real-world
     scenario.
     - E.g. Create an `Animal` parent class with multiple animal subclasses that
       inherit information from the parent class.

3. Polymorphism

   - Create a program that uses polymorphism through method overriding and/or
     method overloading.
   - Use the `isinstance()` function to check the type of an object.
   - Write a program that demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in a
     real-world scenario.
     - E.g. Create a shape calculator that calculates the area of different
       shapes such as rectangles, circles, and triangles each with a `area()`
       method.

4. Encapsulation

   - Create a class with private attributes and methods.
   - Use getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes.
