<h1 id="git">Git</h1>
<p>Git is a popular version control system used by software developers
all over the world. Git was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of
the Linux operating system, in 2005, and it quickly became a popular
tool for managing code.</p>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every
developer has a complete copy of the repository on their local machine.
This makes it easy for developers to work on code independently and
collaborate effectively with each other.</p>
<p>Over the years, Git has become an essential tool for software
development, and it is now used by millions of developers around the
world. By learning how to use Git effectively, you can improve your
ability to manage code, collaborate with other developers, and work more
efficiently on software projects.</p>
<p>This learning plan is designed to be completed in five days and
includes a variety of topics, including basic Git concepts, branching
and merging, advanced Git commands, Git workflows, troubleshooting, and
Git extensions. By the end of this learning plan, you should have a
solid understanding of how to use Git and be able to apply your
knowledge to real-world software development projects.</p>

<p><strong>Code Review</strong> - Code review is the process of
reviewing and analyzing code to identify defects, improve code quality,
and ensure compliance with coding standards. Git is often used to
facilitate code review, so learning more about this topic can help you
improve your ability to collaborate effectively with other
developers.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Version Control Systems</strong> - Git is a
distributed version control system, which means that every developer has
a complete copy of the repository on their local machine. There are
other distributed version control systems besides Git, and learning more
about them can help you better understand the advantages and
disadvantages of Git.</p>
