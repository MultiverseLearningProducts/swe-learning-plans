<h1 id="networking-dhcp">Networking: DHCP</h1>
<p>This learning plan is designed to help you understand Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and related protocols, which are
fundamental to network administration and connectivity. DHCP is a
protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses, as well as other
network configuration settings, to devices on a network. By using DHCP,
network administrators can simplify network management and reduce errors
caused by manual IP address configuration.</p>
<p>DHCP was first defined in 1993 by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) in RFC 1531. Since then, DHCP has become a widely used protocol,
with DHCPv4 being used for IPv4 networks and DHCPv6 being used for IPv6
networks. Over time, DHCP has evolved to include more advanced features,
such as relay agents, failover, and dynamic DNS updates.</p>
<p>In this learning plan, you will start by learning the basics of DHCP,
including how it works, the benefits of using DHCP, and the different
types of DHCP messages. You will then move on to configuring a DHCP
server, understanding the different DHCP configuration options
available, and exploring the process of DHCP lease allocation and
renewal. Next, you will learn about DHCPv6, which is used for IPv6
networks, including its differences from DHCPv4 and the different types
of DHCPv6 messages.</p>
<p>After that, you will learn about the relationship between DHCP and
DNS, including how DHCP can be used to automatically assign DNS server
information to devices on a network, and explore the different DHCP
options related to DNS configuration. Finally, you will learn about DHCP
security threats and how to mitigate them, including the different types
of DHCP attacks, such as rogue DHCP servers and DHCP spoofing, and best
practices for securing DHCP servers and clients on a network.</p>
<p>By completing this learning plan, you will have a comprehensive
understanding of DHCP and related protocols, which will enable you to
configure, manage, and troubleshoot networks more effectively.</p>
