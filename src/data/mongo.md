# Mongo DB

## 1. Introduction to MongoDB

1. Learn about what MongoDB is, its features, and its use cases

   - Read the MongoDB Overview: https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb
   - Read the MongoDB Features: https://www.mongodb.com/features
   - Read the MongoDB Use Cases: https://www.mongodb.com/use-cases

2. Get familiar with the terminology and concepts used in MongoDB

   - Read the MongoDB Glossary:
     https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/
   - Understand the key concepts in MongoDB, such as collections, documents,
     fields, and indexes.

3. Install and set up MongoDB on your local machine

   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:
     https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
   - Verify that the MongoDB server is running.

4. Create your first MongoDB database and collection

   - Open the MongoDB shell and create a new database: `use mydatabase`
   - Create a new collection in the database:
     `db.createCollection("mycollection")`
   - Insert a document into the collection:
     `db.mycollection.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", age: 30 })`

5. Connect to MongoDB using the MongoDB shell

   - Open the MongoDB shell: `mongo`
   - Connect to a MongoDB server: `mongo <host>:<port>/<database>`
   - Authenticate with a MongoDB user:
     `mongo -u <username> -p <password> --authenticationDatabase <auth-database> <host>:<port>/<database>`

By completing these tasks, you'll have a good foundation for understanding
MongoDB and working with it using the MongoDB shell.
