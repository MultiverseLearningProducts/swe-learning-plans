<h1 id="go">Go</h1>
<p>Go (also known as Golang) is a statically-typed, compiled programming
language that was created by Google in 2007. It was initially designed
by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, who sought to create a
language that was efficient, scalable, and easy to use. Go was
officially announced in 2009 and has since become increasingly popular
among developers.</p>
<p>Go is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and readability. Some of
its key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built-in concurrency support: Go has a unique approach to
concurrency that makes it easy for developers to write code that can
execute multiple tasks simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Fast compilation</strong>: Go code can be compiled very
quickly, which makes it a popular choice for projects that require
development.</li>
<li><strong>Garbage collection</strong>: Go has an automatic garbage
collector that helps manage memory usage and reduces the risk of memory
leaks.</li>
<li><strong>Strong typing</strong>: Go is a statically-typed language,
which means that type errors are caught at compile-time rather than
run-time.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform compatibility</strong>: Go can be compiled to
run on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Windows,
and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go is often used for building network services and web applications,
but it can also be used for a variety of other projects. Some common
use-cases for Go include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building APIs and microservices</li>
<li>Writing system-level software</li>
<li>Developing command-line tools</li>
<li>Building data pipelines and processing large amounts of data</li>
<li>Creating network tools and utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Go is a versatile and powerful programming language that is
well-suited for a variety of use-cases. Its unique features and
ease-of-use have made it a popular choice among developers, particularly
those working on projects that require high performance and
concurrency.</p>

<li><strong>Idea #1 - Contact Management System</strong>: Develop a
contact management system that allows users to store and manage their
contacts. The program should use a struct to represent each contact,
containing fields like name, email, and phone number. You should use
pointers to dynamically allocate memory for new contacts and manipulate
the contact details using pointer operations. Additionally, you should
implement error handling to validate user inputs, such as checking for
duplicate contacts or ensuring valid email formats.</li>
<li><strong>Idea #2 - File Reader and Analyzer</strong>: Create a
program that reads a text file, analyzes its contents, and provides
various statistics. The program should use a struct to store the
analysis results, such as the number of lines, words, and characters in
the file. You should utilize pointers to pass the struct as a parameter
to different functions for processing and updating the analysis results.
Error handling should be implemented to handle file read errors or
invalid file formats.</li>
