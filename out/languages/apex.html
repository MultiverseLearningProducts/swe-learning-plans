<h1 id="apex">Apex</h1>
<p>Apex is a programming language designed specifically for the
Salesforce platform. It was created by Salesforce in 2007 and has since
become an integral part of the Salesforce ecosystem. Apex allows
developers to build custom functionality within Salesforce, such as
custom workflows, triggers, and user interfaces.</p>
<p>Apex is an object-oriented language that is similar in syntax to
Java. It runs on the Salesforce platform and is optimized for building
applications that interact with Salesforce data. Apex includes a number
of features that are specific to Salesforce, such as the ability to
access and manipulate data in Salesforce‚Äôs database, and the ability to
create custom user interfaces using the Visualforce framework.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Apex has undergone several updates and
improvements, including the introduction of new features such as the
Lightning Component Framework and the Salesforce DX development
environment. Today, Apex remains a critical tool for Salesforce
developers, and is widely used to build custom applications and
integrations on the platform.</p>
<p>The 5-day learning plan that we have outlined is designed to provide
a solid foundation for learning Apex programming, including the
fundamentals of Apex syntax, object-oriented programming concepts,
triggers, Visualforce, and integration with external systems. By
following this learning plan and continuing to practice and build
projects, you can become proficient in Apex programming and unlock new
opportunities as a Salesforce developer.</p>
