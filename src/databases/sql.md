# SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to manage and
manipulate relational databases. It was first developed in the 1970s by IBM
researchers, who were looking for a way to query and manage data stored in
relational databases.

SQL has since become the standard language for relational database management
systems (RDBMS), and is used by many popular database systems, including MySQL,
Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

Learning SQL is an important skill for anyone who works with data, including
analysts, developers, and data scientists. It allows you to extract insights
from large sets of data and to manipulate and manage databases efficiently.

In this learning plan, you will be introduced to SQL through a step-by-step
process that covers the basics of SQL, filtering and sorting data, advanced
queries, modifying data, and advanced topics like subqueries, aggregate
functions, and views.

By the end of this learning plan, you will have a solid foundation in SQL and
the ability to write SQL queries to manipulate and manage data in a variety of
contexts. With SQL being such an essential tool for data management and
analysis, mastering it will give you a valuable skill set for many industries
and applications.

## Build Something with SQL!

Here are a few project ideas that you can work on to practice your SQL skills:

- **Movie or Book Database**: Create a database of your favorite movies or books
  with details such as title, author/ director, release year, genre, and rating.
  Write SQL queries to retrieve specific data, such as all the movies released
  in a particular year or all the books in a specific genre.
- **E-Commerce Database**: Build a simple e-commerce website database that
  stores information about customers, orders, and products. Write SQL queries to
  retrieve customer order history or to track inventory levels.
- **News Database**: Design a database for a blog or news website that stores
  articles, authors, and comments. Write SQL queries to display the most popular
  articles, show recent comments, or retrieve articles by a specific author.
- **Social Media Member Management**: Create a social media database that stores
  information about users, posts, and comments. Write SQL queries to display a
  user's posts, retrieve all comments on a post, or show the most active users.
- **Sports Information Database**: Build a database for a sports team or league
  that stores information about players, games, and scores. Write SQL queries to
  retrieve information about a specific game, show the top-scoring players, or
  display a team's win-loss record.

## Next Steps

Once you have completed your learning plan, there are several things you can do
to continue improving your SQL skills:

- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** - understanding how to use a specific
  DBMS, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, can help you work more efficiently with
  databases and learn new features and capabilities that are specific to the
  system.
- **Data Visualization** - SQL is often used in conjunction with data
  visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries like
  Matplotlib or Seaborn. Learning how to create data visualizations can help you
  better understand data and communicate your findings to others.
