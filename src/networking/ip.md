# Networking: Internet Protocol

The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol used for communication between devices on a network. The most commonly used version of IP is IPv4, which was developed in the 1980s and is still widely used today. However, the limited number of available IPv4 addresses has led to the development of IPv6, which provides a much larger address space and other benefits.

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long and are represented in dotted-decimal notation (e.g. 192.168.1.1). The address space is divided into classes, with Class A, B, and C being the most commonly used. Subnetting is used to divide a network into smaller subnetworks, each with its own range of IP addresses.

IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are 128 bits long and are represented in hexadecimal notation (e.g. 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). The larger address space allows for more unique addresses, which is becoming increasingly important as more and more devices are connected to the internet.

In addition to addressing, routing is a key aspect of IP networking. Routers are used to forward packets between networks, and routing protocols are used to determine the best path for packets to take.

Over the years, various routing protocols have been developed for IPv4 and IPv6 networks, including OSPF, BGP, and RIP. The Transport Layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP, are also important for reliable communication between devices.

Metwork security is an essential aspect of IP networking, as the internet has become a target for various threats like DDoS attacks, malware, and hacking. Security protocols like IPSec and SSL/TLS are used to protect IP networks, and emerging technologies like SDN are changing the way we design and manage networks.

This learning plan will provide a comprehensive introduction to IP networking, including the basics of IP addressing, subnetting, routing, Transport Layer protocols, network security, and emerging technologies like SDN.
