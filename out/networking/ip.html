<h1 id="networking-internet-protocol">Networking: Internet Protocol</h1>
<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol used for communication
between devices on a network. The most commonly used version of IP is
IPv4, which was developed in the 1980s and is still widely used today.
However, the limited number of available IPv4 addresses has led to the
development of IPv6, which provides a much larger address space and
other benefits.</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long and are represented in dotted-decimal
notation (e.g. 192.168.1.1). The address space is divided into classes,
with Class A, B, and C being the most commonly used. Subnetting is used
to divide a network into smaller subnetworks, each with its own range of
IP addresses.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are 128 bits long and are
represented in hexadecimal notation
(e.g. 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). The larger address space
allows for more unique addresses, which is becoming increasingly
important as more and more devices are connected to the internet.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing, routing is a key aspect of IP networking.
Routers are used to forward packets between networks, and routing
protocols are used to determine the best path for packets to take.</p>
<p>Over the years, various routing protocols have been developed for
IPv4 and IPv6 networks, including OSPF, BGP, and RIP. The Transport
Layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP, are also important for reliable
communication between devices.</p>
<p>Metwork security is an essential aspect of IP networking, as the
internet has become a target for various threats like DDoS attacks,
malware, and hacking. Security protocols like IPSec and SSL/TLS are used
to protect IP networks, and emerging technologies like SDN are changing
the way we design and manage networks.</p>
<p>This learning plan will provide a comprehensive introduction to IP
networking, including the basics of IP addressing, subnetting, routing,
Transport Layer protocols, network security, and emerging technologies
like SDN.</p>
