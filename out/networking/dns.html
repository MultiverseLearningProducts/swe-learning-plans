<h1 id="networking-dns">Networking: DNS</h1>
<p>Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet
infrastructure that translates human-readable domain names, like
<code>www.example.com</code>, into machine-readable IP addresses, like
<code>192.0.2.1</code>. DNS plays a vital role in the functioning of the
Internet, and understanding its principles and mechanisms is essential
for anyone interested in network administration, cybersecurity, or
software engineering.</p>
<p>DNS was developed in the early 1980s by Paul Mockapetris, as a
replacement for the previous system of host tables that mapped IP
addresses to hostnames. The first official specification of DNS was
published in 1983, and it has undergone several revisions and updates
since then.</p>
<p>Today, DNS is a complex and distributed system that involves many
different components, including domain registrars, DNS servers, caching
servers, and resolver libraries. Understanding how these components work
together to resolve domain names is crucial for troubleshooting network
issues and ensuring the reliability and security of Internet
communications.</p>
<p>This plan will guide your through learning the basics of DNS,
including its history, structure, and mechanisms. You will also learn
about related protocols like DHCP and NTP, and explore security
considerations and management tools. By the end, you should have a good
understanding of DNS and related technologies, and be able to apply this
knowledge to real-world networking scenarios.</p>
