# Networking: DHCP

This learning plan is designed to help you understand Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) and related protocols, which are fundamental to network
administration and connectivity. DHCP is a protocol used to automatically assign
IP addresses, as well as other network configuration settings, to devices on a
network. By using DHCP, network administrators can simplify network management
and reduce errors caused by manual IP address configuration.

DHCP was first defined in 1993 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in
RFC 1531. Since then, DHCP has become a widely used protocol, with DHCPv4 being
used for IPv4 networks and DHCPv6 being used for IPv6 networks. Over time, DHCP
has evolved to include more advanced features, such as relay agents, failover,
and dynamic DNS updates.

In this learning plan, you will start by learning the basics of DHCP, including
how it works, the benefits of using DHCP, and the different types of DHCP
messages. You will then move on to configuring a DHCP server, understanding the
different DHCP configuration options available, and exploring the process of
DHCP lease allocation and renewal. Next, you will learn about DHCPv6, which is
used for IPv6 networks, including its differences from DHCPv4 and the different
types of DHCPv6 messages.

After that, you will learn about the relationship between DHCP and DNS,
including how DHCP can be used to automatically assign DNS server information to
devices on a network, and explore the different DHCP options related to DNS
configuration. Finally, you will learn about DHCP security threats and how to
mitigate them, including the different types of DHCP attacks, such as rogue DHCP
servers and DHCP spoofing, and best practices for securing DHCP servers and
clients on a network.

By completing this learning plan, you will have a comprehensive understanding of
DHCP and related protocols, which will enable you to configure, manage, and
troubleshoot networks more effectively.
