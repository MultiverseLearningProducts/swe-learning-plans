2. Learn about inheritance

   - [ ] Create a subclass that inherits from a superclass.
   - [ ] Override a method in the subclass.
   - [ ] Use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes that models a
         real-world scenario.

3. Learn about polymorphism

   - [ ] Create a program that uses polymorphism to process objects of different
         classes.
   - [ ] Use the isinstance() function to check the type of an object.
   - [ ] Write a program that demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in a
         real-world scenario.

4. Learn about encapsulation

   - [ ] Create a class with private attributes and methods.
   - [ ] Use getter and setter methods to access and modify private attributes.
   - [ ] Write a program that uses encapsulation to protect data in a real-world
         scenario.

## 4. Advanced Python

- Learn about regular expressions
- Learn about web scraping
- Learn about data visualization

These topics could easily take a day each - don't try to become an expert in all
of it, just take a few hours to explore each one so that you know what is
possible with Python and see a few interesting patterns.

### Tasks

1. Learn about regular expressions

   - [ ] Understand the basics of regular expressions
   - [ ] Learn how to use the re module to search for and manipulate strings

   - [ ] Understand the basics of creating plots and charts
   - [ ] Do an exercise involving data visualization

## 5. Review

- Review and practice what you have learned
- Explore additional Python topics
- Work on a personal project

When you have time, it is important to keep practising: exercises,
mini-projects, whatever keeps you motivated.

### Tasks

1. Review and practice what you have learned

   - [ ] Go over the concepts covered in the previous days
   - [ ] Do some practice exercises to reinforce your understanding

2. Explore additional Python topics

   - [ ] Learn about advanced Python topics that interest you, such as
         multithreading, network programming, or machine learning
   - [ ] Do some research and find resources to learn more about these topics

3. Work on a personal project

   - [ ] Choose a project that interests you and use Python to implement it
   - [ ] Practice your skills and explore new concepts while working on your
         project.

## Project ideas

Here are some examples of Python projects that you can build to practice your
skills:

**Calculator** Build a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic
arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**File Organizer** Build a script that can organize files in a directory based
on their file type or other criteria. For example, you can move all images to an
"Images" folder, all documents to a "Documents" folder, etc.

**Password Manager** Build a simple command-line password manager that can store
and retrieve passwords for different accounts. You can add additional features
like encryption and decryption of passwords.

**Web Scraper** Build a script that can scrape data from a website and store it
in a database or a CSV file. You can use libraries like Beautiful Soup and
Requests to make the task easier.

**Word Count Tool** Build a script that can count the number of words, lines,
and characters in a text file. You can add additional features like sorting the
results by frequency and generating a word cloud.

These projects will allow you to practice your Python skills without requiring a
framework like Flask or Django. As you work on these projects, don't be afraid
to experiment and add your own features and functionalities. Good luck!
