<h1 id="terraform">Terraform</h1>
<p>Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and
versioning infrastructure. It was created by HashiCorp, a company that
also created other popular DevOps tools like Vagrant, Consul, and Vault.
The first version of Terraform was released in 2014, and it has since
become one of the most widely used infrastructure as code tools.</p>
<p>Terraform uses a declarative language to describe infrastructure
resources like virtual machines, load balancers, and databases. This
means that you don‚Äôt have to write scripts to provision or configure
infrastructure; instead, you can define the desired state of your
infrastructure using Terraform code, and Terraform will manage the
infrastructure for you.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of Terraform is that it supports multiple
cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many others.
This makes it easy to manage infrastructure resources across multiple
cloud providers using a single tool.</p>
<p>Terraform has also been adopted by many organizations for managing
their infrastructure. It provides a standardized way of managing
infrastructure resources and allows teams to collaborate on
infrastructure changes using version control.</p>
<p>Overall, Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as
code, and it‚Äôs an essential skill for anyone working in DevOps or cloud
computing. This learning plan is designed to help you get started with
Terraform and build your skills from the basics to more advanced
topics.</p>

interpolation, and remote backends. You can also learn about the best
practices for writing Terraform code and managing infrastructure at
scale.</li>
<li><strong>Build more projects</strong>: Build more complex projects to
apply your Terraform knowledge and gain more experience. You can also
try to recreate an existing infrastructure using Terraform to understand
how it works.</li>
