# Oracle SQL

Oracle SQL is a powerful database query language used to interact with Oracle
Database. It allows users to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in
relational databases. This learning plan is designed to guide you through the
fundamental concepts of Oracle SQL over the course of several sessions. By the
end of this plan, you should have a solid foundation in querying databases using
Oracle SQL.

  SQL Developer.

## 3. Basic SQL Queries

- **SELECT Statement**: Understand the basic syntax of the `SELECT` statement to
  retrieve data from a single table.
- **WHERE Clause**: Learn how to filter data using the `WHERE` clause to
  retrieve specific rows.
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Explore the `ORDER BY` clause to sort query results.

  logical operators, comparisons, and pattern matching.
- **Sorting with Multiple Columns**: Understand how to sort query results based
  on multiple columns.

## 5. Joining Tables

- **Understanding Joins**: Learn about different types of joins (INNER, LEFT,
  RIGHT, FULL) to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Table Aliases**: Understand how to use table aliases for more readable and
  concise queries.
- **Self-Joins**: Explore the concept of self-joins for querying data within the
  same table.

## 6. Aggregating Data

- **Aggregate Functions**: Learn about aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX,
  COUNT) to perform calculations on groups of rows.
- **GROUP BY Clause**: Understand how to group rows based on one or more
  columns.
- **HAVING Clause**: Learn how to filter grouped data using the `HAVING` clause.

## 7. Subqueries

- **Single-Row Subqueries**: Understand and use single-row subqueries to
  retrieve data from one table and use it in the main query.
- **Multi-Row Subqueries**: Explore multi-row subqueries that return multiple
  rows for comparison.
- **Correlated Subqueries**: Understand correlated subqueries and their use in
  referencing columns from the outer query.

## 8. Modifying Data

- **INSERT Statement**: Learn how to insert new rows into a table using the
  `INSERT` statement.
- **UPDATE Statement**: Understand how to modify existing data using the
  `UPDATE` statement.
