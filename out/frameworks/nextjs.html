<h1 id="next.js">Next.js</h1>
<p>Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-side
rendered and statically generated web applications. It was first
released in 2016 by Zeit, a company that was later acquired by Vercel.
Since then, Next.js has gained popularity in the web development
community due to its ability to easily create scalable and performant
web applications.</p>
<p>Next.js was created to solve some of the challenges faced by
developers when building React applications, such as slow initial page
load times and difficulty implementing server-side rendering. It
provides features such as automatic code splitting, server-side
rendering, and static site generation out of the box, making it easier
to create high-performing web applications.</p>
<p>In recent years, Next.js has been adopted by many big-name companies
like Hulu, Twitch, and Nike to build their web applications. This has
led to increased community support and the development of many useful
plugins and libraries for Next.js.</p>
<p>This learning plan is designed to provide you with a solid foundation
in Next.js, from the basics of pages and routing to more advanced topics
like data fetching and deployment. By the end of this plan, you should
have the skills to build your own Next.js applications and be
well-equipped to continue learning and exploring the framework on your
own.</p>
