<h1 id="microsoft-visual-studio">Microsoft Visual Studio</h1>
<p>This learning plan is designed to take you from a beginner to a
confident user of Visual Studio, one of the most popular and powerful
integrated development environments (IDE) in the world.</p>
<p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an IDE created by Microsoft for developing
computer programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as web sites, web apps,
web services, and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software
development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows
Presentation Foundation, Windows Store, and Microsoft Silverlight. It
can produce both native code and managed code.</p>
<p>Visual Studio was first released in 1997 and since then has evolved
into a complex and versatile IDE that supports multiple programming
languages and is used by developers across the globe. It has had several
versions with the most notable ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Studio 6.0 (1998):</strong> One of the earlier
versions that were widely used for COM programming.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio .NET (2002):</strong> Introduced the .NET
framework and was a big shift towards modern managed code development in
a variety of .NET languages.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio 2005-2008:</strong> Brought enhancements for
.NET 2.0 and 3.5, introducing LINQ and AJAX support.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio 2010-2012:</strong> Came with improved UI,
support for Windows 7, and parallel programming features.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio 2013-2015:</strong> Integrated with cloud
services, and provided robust web development tools with ASP.NET.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio 2017-2019:</strong> Offered a more lightweight
and modular installation, improved performance, and better support for
modern development needs, including mobile and cloud-based apps.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Studio 2022:</strong> Is the latest as of my last
update, providing native support for ARM64 development, improved Git
tooling, and many more features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visual Studio Community Edition, which is free and fully-featured, is
an excellent option for individual developers, open-source projects,
academic research, and small professional teams.</p>
<p>The IDE has become known for its powerful features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IntelliSense:</strong> A code-completion aid that includes a
number of features: List Members, Parameter Info, Quick Info, and
Complete Word.</li>
<li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Works both as a source-level debugger and
a machine-level debugger.</li>
<li><strong>Code Profiler:</strong> Collects detailed timing information
about the code that is running in the background.</li>
<li><strong>Designers:</strong> Offers Windows Forms Designer, WPF
Designer, Web Designer, Data Designer, and Class Designer among
others.</li>
</ul>
<p>With its extensive support for programming languages like C#, VB.NET,
C++, F#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more, Visual Studio has
been instrumental in pushing forward software development practices and
standards.</p>
<p>This 5-day plan is tailored to immerse you in the core features and
workflows of Visual Studio, enabling you to navigate and utilize the IDE
effectively for your development projects. Whether you’re aiming to
develop desktop applications, web apps, or mobile apps, this plan sets
the foundation you’ll need to get started.</p>
<p>Each day is structured to gradually build your competence, starting
with the IDE setup, moving through code editing, debugging, and testing,
and finally looking at UI design, extensions, and deployment. By the end
of the plan, not only will you be well-versed in the fundamental tools
and functionalities of Visual Studio, but you’ll also have a roadmap for
continuous learning and improvement.</p>
<p>Before diving into the daily plan, ensure you have access to a
computer that meets the system requirements for Visual Studio. You’ll be
downloading and installing the Community Edition, which is free for
individual developers, open-source projects, educational purposes, and
small professional teams.</p>
<p>Learning a complex tool like Visual Studio is an iterative process.
The more you practice and engage with the software, the more skilled
you’ll become.</p>
