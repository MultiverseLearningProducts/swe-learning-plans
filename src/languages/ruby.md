# Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language that stands out for its elegant and readable syntax. Designed with a focus on developer happiness and productivity, Ruby's distinguishing features make it a favorite among programmers. One of its key characteristics is its readability, as its syntax closely resembles natural language, making it easy for both beginners and experienced developers to understand and write code. The language's dynamic typing allows for flexibility by determining variable types at runtime, contributing to its expressive nature. Everything in Ruby is treated as an object, even basic data types and functions, promoting consistency and a uniform programming style.

Ruby's strengths also lie in its metaprogramming capabilities, which empower developers to modify and extend the language itself. This aspect has led to the creation of domain-specific languages (DSLs) tailored to specific tasks, further highlighting Ruby's versatility. One of its primary attractions is its gentle learning curve, aided by its intuitive syntax and strong community support. This aspect makes it accessible to those new to programming, enabling them to quickly grasp its concepts and write functional code.

Originating in the mid-1990s, Ruby was brought to life by Yukihiro Matsumoto, often known as "Matz." With the first public release in 1995, Matsumoto aimed to design a language that harmoniously blended functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming paradigms. Ruby gained substantial popularity in the early 2000s, largely thanks to the emergence of Ruby on Rails (RoR) in 2004. Ruby on Rails, a web application framework built on top of Ruby, streamlined web development and propelled Ruby further into the spotlight.

Ruby's applications are diverse and reflect its adaptability. In web development, Ruby on Rails simplifies building web applications through its elegant syntax and conventions. Ruby's scripting capabilities make it ideal for automation and scripting tasks. The language's concise syntax also lends itself well to rapid prototyping, enabling quick conceptualization and experimentation. For graphical user interface (GUI) applications, libraries like Shoes and Tk allow developers to create interfaces. Additionally, Ruby is employed in game development, particularly for scripting and crafting small games. Its robust string manipulation features and regular expression support make it effective for text processing, and it finds utility in system administration tasks through the creation of Ruby scripts.

This learning plan is designed to introduce you to the basics of programming with Ruby and help you build a solid foundation in the language. Over the course of five days, you will learn about topics such as basic syntax, data structures, object-oriented programming, file I/O, and more. By the end of the learning plan, you should have a good understanding of the key concepts and tools used in Ruby.

      [download the latest version of Ruby from the official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). Follow the instructions to install based on the type of machine you have.
2. Basics of Ruby Syntax:
   - Understand variables, data types, and basic operations in Ruby.
   - Learn about strings, numbers, and boolean values.
   - Familiarize yourself with basic operators (`+`, `-`, `\*`, `/`, and `%`).
3. Control Flow:
   - Learn about if statements and conditional expressions.
   - Explore different types of loops (while, for).
4. Build Something üî®
   - **Command Line Program**: Write simple programs that use variables, perform calculations, and make decisions based on conditions.

## 2. Functions and Methods

### Tasks

1. Functions and Methods:
   - Understand the concept of functions (methods in Ruby).
   - Learn how to define and call functions.
   - Explore parameter passing and return values.
2. Scope and Variables:
   - Learn about local and global variables.
   - Understand variable scope within functions.
3. Build Something üî®
   - **Option #1: Rock, Paper, Scissors**: You now know enough to rebuild your Rock, Paper, Scissors project! Your project should include the following:
     - Randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors for each player in the game. You should explore how to use generate random numbers in Ruby
     - Determines the winner of the game based on the random values that were selected.
   - **Option #2: To-Do List**: Create a simple application that allows users to create, edit, and delete todo items. You could also add features such as due dates, reminders, and categories.

## 3. Data Structures

### Tasks
1. Arrays:
   - Learn how to create and manipulate arrays.
   - Understand common array methods (`push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`).
2. Hashes (Dictionaries):
   - Explore how to create and work with hashes.
   - Learn about hash methods for manipulation.
3. Iteration and Enumerators:
   - Understand how to iterate over arrays and hashes.
   - Learn about iterators like `each`, `map`, and `select`.
