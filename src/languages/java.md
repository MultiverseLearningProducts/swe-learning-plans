# Java

Java is a popular programming language that was first introduced by Sun
Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to be portable, secure, and easy to use,
and it quickly gained popularity among developers. Today, Java is used to build
a wide variety of applications, from desktop and mobile apps to large-scale
enterprise systems.

This learning plan is designed to introduce you to the basics of Java
programming and help you build a solid foundation in the language. Over the
course of five days, you will learn about topics such as basic syntax,
object-oriented programming, exception handling, file I/O, and more. By the end
of the learning plan, you should have a good understanding of the key concepts
and tools used in Java programming.

Java has evolved significantly since its inception, with new versions and
updates being released regularly. The language is maintained by Oracle
Corporation, which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010. Today, Java is widely used
in the enterprise space and is also a popular choice for building Android mobile
apps.

Learning Java can be a great way to expand your programming skills and open up
new career opportunities. We hope that this learning plan will provide you with
a solid foundation in Java programming and help you get started on your journey
to becoming a skilled Java developer.

and implement polymorphism.

### Tasks

1. Understanding Object-Oriented Programming

   - [ ] **Research and Read About Object-Oriented Programming**: You can start
         by reading about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and be able
         to explain the following concepts:

         it allows you to create new classes that are based on existing classes.
         Inheritance allows you to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes.
   - [ ] **Create Subclasses**: Create new classes that inherit from existing
         classes. Subclasses can add new fields and methods, or override
         existing ones.
   - [ ] **Implement Polymorphism**: Understand polymorphism in Java and how it
         allows you to use objects of different classes in the same way.
         Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding or through the
         use of interfaces.
