# Apex

Apex is a programming language designed specifically for the Salesforce platform. It was created by Salesforce in 2007 and has since become an integral part of the Salesforce ecosystem. Apex allows developers to build custom functionality within Salesforce, such as custom workflows, triggers, and user interfaces.

Apex is an object-oriented language that is similar in syntax to Java. It runs on the Salesforce platform and is optimized for building applications that interact with Salesforce data. Apex includes a number of features that are specific to Salesforce, such as the ability to access and manipulate data in Salesforce's database, and the ability to create custom user interfaces using the Visualforce framework.

Since its inception, Apex has undergone several updates and improvements, including the introduction of new features such as the Lightning Component Framework and the Salesforce DX development environment. Today, Apex remains a critical tool for Salesforce developers, and is widely used to build custom applications and integrations on the platform.

The 5-day learning plan that we have outlined is designed to provide a solid foundation for learning Apex programming, including the fundamentals of Apex syntax, object-oriented programming concepts, triggers, Visualforce, and integration with external systems. By following this learning plan and continuing to practice and build projects, you can become proficient in Apex programming and unlock new opportunities as a Salesforce developer.
