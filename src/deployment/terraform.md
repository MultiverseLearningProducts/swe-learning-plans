# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning
infrastructure. It was created by HashiCorp, a company that also created other
popular DevOps tools like Vagrant, Consul, and Vault. The first version of
Terraform was released in 2014, and it has since become one of the most widely
used infrastructure as code tools.

Terraform uses a declarative language to describe infrastructure resources like
virtual machines, load balancers, and databases. This means that you don't have
to write scripts to provision or configure infrastructure; instead, you can
define the desired state of your infrastructure using Terraform code, and
Terraform will manage the infrastructure for you.

One of the key benefits of Terraform is that it supports multiple cloud
platforms, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and many others. This makes it
easy to manage infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers using a
single tool.

Terraform has also been adopted by many organizations for managing their
infrastructure. It provides a standardized way of managing infrastructure
resources and allows teams to collaborate on infrastructure changes using
version control.

Overall, Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code, and
it's an essential skill for anyone working in DevOps or cloud computing. This
learning plan is designed to help you get started with Terraform and build your
skills from the basics to more advanced topics.

## Build Something with Terraform! üî®

Here are some project ideas that you can build to test your Terraform skills:

- **Create a Web Server Infrastructure**: Build a web server infrastructure on
  AWS or any other cloud platform using Terraform. The infrastructure should
  include an EC2 instance, a load balancer, and a database.
- **Multi-Environment Infrastructure**: Build a multi-environment infrastructure
  using Terraform. Create separate environments for development, staging, and
  production with different configurations.
- **Autoscaling Infrastructure**: Build an autoscaling infrastructure using
  Terraform. The infrastructure should automatically scale based on the load on
  the web servers.
- **Container Infrastructure**: bBild a container infrastructure using
  Terraform. Use Terraform to create an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster
  on AWS and deploy a containerized application to the cluster.
- **Serverless Infrastructure**: Build a serverless infrastructure using
  Terraform. Use Terraform to create an AWS Lambda function and API Gateway to
  create a serverless REST API.
- **Infrastructure as Code for a CMS**: Build an infrastructure as code for a
  CMS like Wordpress or Joomla. You can use Terraform to create the
  infrastructure that will host the CMS, including the database and web server.

## Next Steps

Here are some next steps to help you continue your Terraform learning journey:

- **Certifications**: Consider getting certified in Terraform to validate your
  knowledge and demonstrate your skills to potential employers. HashiCorp offers
  a Terraform Associate certification that you can earn by passing a
  certification exam.
- **Explore advanced topics**: After completing the basic learning plan, you can
  explore more advanced topics like data sources, interpolation, and remote
  backends. You can also learn about the best practices for writing Terraform
  code and managing infrastructure at scale.
- **Build more projects**: Build more complex projects to apply your Terraform
  knowledge and gain more experience. You can also try to recreate an existing
  infrastructure using Terraform to understand how it works.
