# Learning Plans

This page contains all of the Learning Plans you can use throughout Bootcamp Part 3.

## How To Use This Page
1. With your coach and manager, select the languages, frameworks/libraries, databases, and/or cloud/deployment/tooling learning plans that you plan to complete before starting your job.
2. Locate the learning plan that corresponds to your selection above using the table below.
3. Develop a plan for how you will complete all of the required components by the end of week 10.
4. Create a repository that will have all of the code you create as you complete the learning plan.
5. Explore courses and documentation to learn the skills that are outlined in the learning build.
6. Rebuild Bootcamp projects using the new skills you have learned! For example:
    - If you you learning an object oriented language like Java or C#, then try rebuilding the Scooter project but in the language you are learning.
    - If you are learning about an ORM, try rebuilding the Card Game Project with this ORM.
