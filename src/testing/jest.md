articles, or currency conversion) and explore its documentation. Write Jest
tests to validate the API responses for different endpoints and scenarios.

   - Practice using test doubles and dependency injection with Jest.

3. Integration testing:

   - Understand the basics of integration testing and its role in the testing
     pyramid.
   - Learn to write integration tests using Jest.
   - Explore techniques for setting up test environments and handling
     dependencies.

4. Jest configuration and customization:

   - Learn about Jest configuration options, such as setupFiles and transform.
   - Explore customizing Jest's behavior using configuration files.
   - Practice configuring Jest for different project requirements.

**Mini-project**: React Component Testing. Create a simple React component
(e.g., a button, form, or card) with different props and states. Write Jest
tests to validate the rendering and behavior of the component. Use snapshot
testing to capture and validate the component's rendered output. Implement
integration tests to verify the interactions between multiple components or test
component APIs.

## 4. Test Organization and Best Practices

1. Test organization and naming conventions:

   - Learn best practices for organizing and naming test files and test suites.
   - Understand the importance of clear and descriptive test names.
   - Explore naming conventions for test files and test case functions.

2. Test-driven development (TDD):

   - Deepen your understanding of the TDD process and its benefits.
   - Practice writing tests before implementing code using TDD.
   - Learn to iterate and refactor tests during the development process.

3. Test optimization and performance:

   - Explore techniques for improving the speed and efficiency of your tests.
   - Learn to identify and avoid common testing pitfalls.
   - Understand how to write tests that are focused, independent, and
     maintainable.

4. Error handling and edge cases:

   - Learn to write tests that cover error handling and edge cases.
   - Explore techniques for testing error conditions and invalid inputs.
   - Practice writing tests to ensure code correctness in various scenarios.

**Mini-project**: Todo List Testing. Implement a Todo List application with
functionalities like adding, removing, and marking tasks as complete. Write
organized test suites for different components and functionalities of the Todo
List. Practice test-driven development (TDD) by writing tests first and
implementing the corresponding features. Apply best practices like using
descriptive test names, test organization, and focusing on independent test
cases.
