# Microsoft T-SQL

Welcome to your learning plan for T-SQL (Transact-SQL), the language used for querying and managing data in Microsoft SQL Server. T-SQL is a powerful and widely-used language that allows you to interact with SQL Server databases, retrieve and manipulate data, and perform various data-related tasks. By following this learning plan, you will gain a solid foundation in T-SQL and develop the skills necessary to work with SQL Server effectively.

T-SQL is a variant of the SQL (Structured Query Language) standard that was developed specifically for Microsoft SQL Server. It extends the standard SQL language with additional features and capabilities tailored for use in SQL Server. T-SQL was first introduced with SQL Server 6.0 in 1995 and has since evolved with each subsequent release of SQL Server.

Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for storing and managing structured data and is particularly popular for enterprise-level applications and data-intensive workloads. T-SQL is the primary language used in SQL Server to interact with databases and perform a wide range of data manipulation, querying, and administration tasks.

T-SQL supports a rich set of features, including querying data from one or multiple tables, filtering and sorting data, performing aggregations, modifying data, creating and altering database objects, managing transactions, and more. It provides a robust and flexible language for working with databases and enables developers, database administrators, and data analysts to efficiently work with SQL Server.

This learning plan is designed to provide a structured approach to learning T-SQL. It covers essential concepts and skills that will empower you to write T-SQL queries, manipulate data, create and modify database objects, and work with advanced features of T-SQL. Each day of the learning plan focuses on specific topics and tasks to ensure a comprehensive understanding of T-SQL.
