<h1 id="typescript">TypeScript</h1>
<p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static
typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to help developers write
more maintainable and scalable code. It was developed by Microsoft and
first released in 2012.</p>
<p>The goal of TypeScript is to provide a better tool for large-scale
web applications, particularly those built by teams of developers. By
adding type annotations and other features, TypeScript can catch errors
earlier in the development process, make code easier to read and
understand, and improve the overall quality of code.</p>
<p>Since its release, TypeScript has gained popularity among developers
and has been adopted by many large companies, including Airbnb, Asana,
Slack, and others. It has also been integrated into popular front-end
frameworks such as Angular and React, as well as back-end frameworks
such as NestJS.</p>
<p>In this learning plan, we’ll cover the basics of TypeScript,
including its features and benefits, as well as how to use it to write
clean, maintainable code. By the end of this plan, you’ll have a solid
understanding of TypeScript and be able to use it to build your own web
applications.</p>
